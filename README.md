# ALPRunner

A package with the singlet scalar RGEs upto mass-dim-5 implemented, and functions to numerically solve the running. A couple of examples exploring singlet phenomenology across energies, with necessary documentation of the package functions for users is provided.

These files are available in ALPRunner.zip . Additional examples and demonstrations will be added to ALPRunner_Guide.nb file.
