# ALPRunner

A package with the singlet scalar RGEs upto mass-dim-5 implemented, and functions to numerically solve the running. A couple of examples exploring singlet phenomenology across energies, with necessary documentation of the package functions for users is provided.

These files are available in ALPRunner.zip . Additional examples and demonstrations will be added to ALPRunner_Guide.nb file.

The theory details are available here : [arxiv:2306.08036](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08036.pdf). Please cite the article, if you find the package helpful in some regard.
